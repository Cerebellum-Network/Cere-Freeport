# Freeport

## Mission statement

NFT backed assets lack security and ownership. The Cere Freeport Decentralized Data Vault is the first solution to solve this problem. 

This page provides a quick tutorial on the Freeport Creator Suite and a Quick Start Guide with documentation. It includes a set of Smart Contracts to deal with NFT (ERC1155) and auctions,
high-level services for Cere Decentralised Data Cloud (DDC) to store and retrieve assets and metadata, and a Creator Suite - front-end
application for NFT minting and asset uploads.
