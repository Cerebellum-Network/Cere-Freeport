# Freeport

## Mission statement

Today's NFT backed assets lack security and true ownership. The Cere Freeport (Decentralized Data Vault for NFT) is the first open and decentralized solution for this problem. 

This page provides a quick tutorial on the Freeport Creator Suite and a Quick Start Guide with documentation. It includes a set of Smart Contracts to deal with NFT (ERC1155) and auctions,
high-level services for Cere Decentralised Data Cloud (DDC) to store and retrieve assets and metadata, and a Creator Suite - front-end
application for NFT minting and asset uploads. 

## Tutorial

Connect your Wallet, Create NFTs and view created NFTs.

## Run all services with Docker Compose

1. Create your own API key in [Covalent](https://www.covalenthq.com).
2. Navigate to `docker-compose/` directory `cd docker-compose/`.
3. Put your API key in the `.env` file.
4. Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose-all-dev.yaml up -d` to start all services.

The following services will be exposed:

- Freeport API at port 8080 (http://localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui)
- Freeport DDC proxy at port 8081 (http://localhost:8081/q/swagger-ui)
- DDC Cluster with 3 nodes at ports 8888, 8881, 8882
- S3 service at port 9000 (region: `us-east-1`, access key id: `test-key`, secret access key: `test-secret`)
- PostgreSQL at port 5432 (user: `pg`, password: `pwd`, database: `freeport`)

Test DDC keys:
- Public: `0xdab1b135fbeb366b9a3a2e63d6e05152998dd3046cd91344a615f5ed82c2b431`

Current version of the Docker compose file is pointed to development environment and uses smart contracts from Polygon Mumbai Testnet.
You might need to wait some time until data from chain will be synchronized with local database.
