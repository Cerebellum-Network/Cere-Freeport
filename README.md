# Freeport

## Mission statement

Today's NFT backed assets lack security and true ownership. The Cere Freeport (Decentralized Data Vault for NFT) is the first open and decentralized solution for this problem. 

This page provides a quick tutorial on the Freeport Creator Suite and a Quick Start Guide with documentation. It includes a set of Smart Contracts to deal with NFT (ERC1155) and auctions,
high-level services for Cere Decentralised Data Cloud (DDC) to store and retrieve assets and metadata, and a Creator Suite - front-end
application for NFT minting and asset uploads. 

## Tutorial

Connect your Wallet, Create NFTs and view created NFTs.
